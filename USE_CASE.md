ðŸ“˜ Use Case: Retail Sales Analytics for GIBBS SOLUTIONS

Company Background

GIBBS SOLUTIONS is a fictional online retail company that specializes in selling computers, mobile devices, and accessories. With hundreds of products and daily transactions, the company needs a centralized system to store, manage, and analyze its sales and inventory data.

ðŸ§¹ Problem Statement

Before the database was implemented, GIBBS SOLUTIONS struggled with:

Scattered data across spreadsheets

No visibility into real-time stock levels

Difficulty tracking top-selling products or employee performance

No automated way to identify high-value customers

ðŸ’¡ The Solution

I designed and implemented a cloud-based PostgreSQL database to solve these issues. The database structure includes well-normalized tables for customers, employees, products, suppliers, sales, and sale items.

The solution allows:

Tracking every sale with accurate timestamps

Recording which employee closed which sale

Managing stock levels in real time

Linking each product to a supplier for restocking analysis
